## Problem Statement 

Finding the most commonly occuring business category in an area.

2. To find the most popular category of business in that area

## User Guide 
### Steps

1. Install Maven extension and Spring Boot extensions in IDE
2. Create a new database connection on MySQL Workbench and enter all the required connection parameters of the AWS MySQL database server. 

Host: cs201db.cowijpva0ytl.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306
DB name: cs201g1t1

3. Click on the Test Connection button to connect to the database server.
4. Run the application using the command - "mvn spring-boot:run" in your terminal

#### HTTP methods 
Get the list of all the businesses residing in a particular area identified by its longiture and latitude using a kd-tree and range tree respectively:

GET http://localhost:8080/kd-tree/range-query

GET http://localhost:8080/range-tree/range-query


Find the most popular category amonst these businesses using a list and hashmap respectively:

GET http://localhost:8080/list/categories

GET http://localhost:8080/unique


5. Run the app using `yarn start` 
6. Make sure the backend server (from the cs201-g1t1-yelpdata repository) is also running
7. Click the "Draw" button on the top left corner to start drawing
8. Click anywhere on the map to define the **top left corner**, then click anywhere on the map to define the **bottom right corner**

## Current Limitations
- Code might not follow the conventional best practice
- Rectangles must be drawn from the top left corner to the bottom right corner
- Currently only for the city of Kyle
